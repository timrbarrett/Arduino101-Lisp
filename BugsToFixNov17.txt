Bugs in the Arduino code:

Showstoppers: none
Workarounds: 6

    Fix the unexpected \00 in sd card output. (Bug)
        fix: with if statement
        workaround: ignore undesired characters.


    Fix the ()=>()() problem - processing generates a result then evals again to generate () as a result (Bug)
        consequence: reduces cpu time available.
        fix: loop code needs resequencing
        workaround: ignore extra values. 
    Related(?) Fix the rx20 limit.(Enhancement)


    Fix the ylisp code needing processing twice. (Inelegant)
        consequence: reduces cpu time available
        workaround: ignore extra processing overhead.


    Fix yLisp not starting processing everytime.(Intermittent Bug)
        consequence: reduces multiple reboots required.
        workaround: startup is more uncertain, time consuming for user..


    Fix BLE not appearing everytime.(Intermittent Bug)
        consequence: reduces multiple reboots required.
        workaround: startup is more uncertain, time consuming for user..


    Fix BLE not appearing when powered up by battery. (Bug)
        consequence: booting can only happen when tethered.
        workaround: startup is more uncertain, time consuming for user..

    No strings received ... is a reality of the experimental BLE implementation.

Work around: implement integer-based two-character or four-character response.
